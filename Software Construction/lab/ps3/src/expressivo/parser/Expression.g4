 * Nonterminal rules (a.k.a. parser rules) must be lowercase, e.g. "root" and "sum" below.

 * Terminal rules (a.k.a. lexical rules) must be UPPERCASE, e.g. NUMBER below.
 * Terminals can be defined with quoted strings or regular expressions.
 *
 * You should make sure you have one rule that describes the entire input.
 * This is the "start rule". The start rule should end with the special token
 * EOF so that it describes the entire input. Below, "root" is the start rule.
